# Java Area
---

## Description

Welcome !  
This project is a IFTT like built with `Java`, `MongoDB` and `Spring`.  
An applet is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Twitter, Facebook, ...   
Using the APIs made available by these services.   
I used a simple `bootstrap` template to generate the webview.
